# Horiseon Code Refactor
This page contains a refactored homepage for a hypothetical company seeking to have a standardized codebase that follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

Its code was reformatted to incorporate semantic HTML elements to promote a standardized page structure that allows for easily replication for additional content following a uniform layout and format.

## Application
The homepage can be viewed [here](https://chocochip287.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/).
